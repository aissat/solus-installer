        Coding Style
                * Camel case is strictly forbidden.
                * Underscores are used to separate words when naming variables or functions.
                * Indents are 8 spaces and tabs are forbidden. 
                * Parentheses only need a space before them in conditional constructs.
                * Except for function declarations, curly braces always open on the same line.
                * Each case should be at the same indent level as the switch statement.
                * Stars in pointers are a prefix to the variable name, not a suffix to the type.
                * Always add function declarations.
                * Else statements start on the same line as the if statements closing curly brace.
                * Comments must go on the line above the code that it documents.
                * The 80 character limit is a guideline, not a rule.
                * Single line if and else statements must have curly braces.

        Commits
                * Commit messages must be 80 characters or less.
                * The purpose of the commit is clearly defined in the commit message.
                * Don't group together large changes into one commit, break them up into multiple commits.
                * Do not end your commit message with punctuation.
                * Never make jokes or use vulgar language in commit messages.
