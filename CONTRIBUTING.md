## Coding Style
* Camel case is strictly forbidden.
* Underscores are used to separate words when naming variables or functions.
* Variable and function names should not have more than 4 underscores in them.
* Indents are 8 spaces and tabs are forbidden.
* Parentheses only need a space before them in conditional constructs.
* Except for function declarations, curly braces always open on the same line.
* Each case should be at the same indent level as the switch statement.
* Stars in pointers are a prefix to the variable name, not a suffix to the type.
* Always add function declarations to the relevant header files.
* Else statements start on the same line as the if statements closing curly brace.
* Comments should be as short as possible and not contain jokes or vulgarity.
* Comments must go on the line above the code or block of code that it documents.
* Comments will always use the multiline comment syntax, even if it is only a single line.
* The 80 character limit is a guideline, not a rule.
* If a line becomes too long, find ways to extend it vertically.
* Comma-separated function argument lists that extend too far must have each argument on a separate line.
* Single line if and else statements must have curly braces.

## Commits
* Commit messages must be 80 characters or less.
* The purpose of the commit should always be clearly defined in the commit message.
* Don't group together large changes into one commit, break them up into multiple commits.
* Do not end your commit message with punctuation.
* Never make jokes or use vulgar language in commit messages.
